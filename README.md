# Minimalistic Electron React Redux Boilerplate Code


This is a minimal Electron React Redux boilerplate code using webpack and webpack-loader. It's simple and you can built upon starter code. I know there are tons of boilerplate code out there but either they are too tricky for beginner or just a pain. I wanted to code my app not stuck in configuring for a year. Feel free to improve by commiting changes

## To Use

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/alexakasanjeev/electron-react-quick-start.git your-project-name
# Go into the repository
cd your-project-name
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Start the webpack first
npm run dev
# In different terminal, start app
npm start
```


**After making changes to renderer.js hit Ctrl+R in app window to reload manually**
There is no hot reloading. Every time you change something in any js file make sure to change something in your render.js so webpack can compile again and hit ctrl + R in app window
